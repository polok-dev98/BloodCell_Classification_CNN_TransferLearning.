# About the project:

1. Used data augmentation(Image transformation) for transform the image for better representation.

2. Fine tune the MobileNetV2, VGG16 and Inceptionv3 models for training with images and classifying the blood cell type.

3. Comapring the performance metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix and classification report to each of the model.

4. Generate the prediction with new data.
